# prompt: 
what are some interesting moments that happened in my project. 
As you work on your implementation, some moments will be worth recording. For example, you might discover that your **concept specification was wrong in some way**; a test run might expose a **subtle bug** in a concept implementation; the LLM might generate some code that is unexpectedly good or bad in some way; you might discover a way to simplify your design; and so on. When any such moment arises, you should save a link to the relevant file and place it in your design document. Make sure to save a link to a snapshot in the context area, not a link to a file in the design or source code areas (since those are mutable). If this moment did not arise from running the LLM, you should save the relevant files by creating a little design document to record your observations, and then run the tool with the save option to snapshot the files first.
