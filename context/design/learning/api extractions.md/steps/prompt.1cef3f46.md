# prompt: What do I need to add to my backend for the api routes and specs to work? how do i check where the api are? which link url

**Generate an API spec for your back end and start it up**. Using the `api-extraction` prompt, generate an API spec or your back end. Start the back end running by executing `deno task concepts` in the console. Note the URL that it reports the server is listening on (eg, `http://localhost:8000`).
