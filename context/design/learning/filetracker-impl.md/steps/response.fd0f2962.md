# response:

Based on the strict concept implementation rules you've outlined, particularly:

1. **"No import statements can reference another concept in any way, including type declarations."**

It is **easier and necessary to pass `maxIndex` in as an argument** to the `startTracking` method.

Here's why:

* **Concept Isolation:** The `FileTrackerConcept` is designed to track a user's progress within a file. It is not responsible for knowing the intrinsic properties of the `File` itself, such as its total number of items (`maxIndex`). Those properties would likely be managed by a separate `File` concept (e.g., `FileMetadataConcept` or simply `FileConcept`).
* **Rule 1 Violation:** If `FileTrackerConcept` were to try and "get the `maxIndex` from the file using the file's id," it would have to:
  * Query a MongoDB collection that stores `File` metadata.
  * This collection would either belong to another concept (e.g., `FileConcept`), which would immediately violate "No import statements can reference another concept." The intent of this rule is to ensure concepts are self-contained and don't directly depend on the internal structure or implementation details of other concepts.
  * Alternatively, if it were to query a collection *by name* without importing another concept, it would still be implicitly aware of and dependent on the existence and structure of another concept's data, which goes against the spirit of the isolation rule.

The current approach in your code, where `maxIndex` is passed as an argument to `startTracking`, correctly adheres to the concept's boundaries and the architectural constraints. The entity calling `startTracking` (e.g., an application service layer or another concept that *does* have access to file metadata) would be responsible for looking up the `maxIndex` and providing it.

This keeps `FileTrackerConcept` focused on its core responsibility without violating the principle of concept isolation.
