# response:

Based on the strict concept implementation rules you've outlined, particularly:

1. **"No import statements can reference another concept in any way, including type declarations."**

It is **easier and necessary to pass `maxIndex` in as an argument** to the `startTracking` method.

Here's why:

* **Concept Isolation:** The `FileTrackerConcept` is designed to track a user's progress within a file. It is not responsible for knowing the intrinsic properties of the `File` itself, such as its total number of items (`maxIndex`). Those properties would likely be managed by a separate `File` concept (e.g., `FileMetadataConcept` or simply `FileConcept`).
* **Rule 1 Violation:** If `FileTrackerConcept` were to try and "get the `maxIndex` from the file using the file's id," it would have to:
  * Query a MongoDB collection that stores `File` metadata.
  * This collection would either belong to another concept (e.g., `FileConcept`), which would immediately violate "No import statements can reference another concept."
  * Or, it would imply that `FileTrackerConcept` is also responsible for managing `File` metadata, which contradicts its stated purpose of "track current position and enable navigation within files."

The current approach in your code, where `maxIndex` is passed as an argument to `startTracking`, correctly adheres to the concept's boundaries and the architectural constraints. The entity calling `startTracking` (e.g., an application service layer or another concept that *does* have access to file metadata) would be responsible for looking up the `maxIndex` and providing it.

This keeps `FileTrackerConcept` focused on its core responsibility without violating the principle of concept isolation.
