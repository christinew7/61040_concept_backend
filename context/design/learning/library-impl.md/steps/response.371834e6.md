# response:

The `Image` type is defined as a `String` in this concept implementation due to the strict constraints outlined for concept development:

1. **Action Argument/Result Constraint:** "Every action must take a single argument, and output a single argument: both of these are a dictionary/JSON object with **primitive values (no custom objects)**."

   * An `Image` in its raw form (e.g., binary data, a `Buffer`, or a complex object containing both data and metadata) is **not a primitive value** in TypeScript/JavaScript. It's an object.
   * Therefore, to pass image data or a representation of it through action arguments and results, it must be converted into a primitive type. `String` is one of the most flexible primitive types for this purpose.

2. **Representing Image Content as a String:**
   * **Base64 Encoding:** A common way to embed binary data (like image files) into a string is to use Base64 encoding. The Base64 string is a primitive value and can be stored directly in MongoDB and passed as an action argument/result.
   * **URL/URI:** Alternatively, the `String` could represent a URL or URI where the actual image file is stored externally (e.g., on a cloud storage service like S3, or a CDN). In this case, the `Library` concept doesn't store the image *content* directly but stores a *reference* to it, which is also a primitive string.

By defining `Image` as a `String`, the concept adheres to the rule that all exposed data through actions and queries (which eventually become API endpoints) must be composed of primitive values or `ID`s.
