# context: can you help me update the library spec to include an optional , image Image type that represents the file?

To update the Library concept specification to include an optional `image Image` type that represents the file, we need to:

1. **Define the `Image` type**: Given the constraints that action arguments and results must be primitive values or IDs, and that `Image` "represents the file" (suggesting content, not just a reference), we'll define `Image` as a `String` (e.g., for base64 encoded data or a URL).
2. **Update the `state`**: Add an `image` field of type `String` to the `Files` state, marking it as optional.
3. **Update `createFile` action**: Specify that `createFile` initializes the `image` field as empty/null.
4. **Add new actions**: Introduce actions to `setImageToFile` and `clearImageFromFile` to manage this new optional field.
5. **Add new query**: Introduce a query `_getFileImage` to retrieve the image content.

Here's the updated concept specification:
