# prompt: can you explain what this means when making test cases:

* **No state setup**. Your test cases should not require any setting up of the concept state except by calling concept actions. When you are testing one action at a time, this means that you will want to order your actions carefully (for example, by the operational principle) to avoid having to set up state.
