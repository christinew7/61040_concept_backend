# context:

file1 = (addFileResult as { file: ID }).file;

assertExists(file1, "Library ID should be returned.");

Conversion of type 'Empty | { error: string; }' to type '{ file: ID; }' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.\
Property 'file' is missing in type '{ error: string; }' but required in type '{ file: ID; }'.deno-ts(2352)

LibraryConcept.test.ts(64, 33):Â 'file' is declared here.

const addFileResult: Empty | {\
error: string;\
}
