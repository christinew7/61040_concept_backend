# FileTracker implicit dependency

[Full Response](../context/design/concepts/FileTracker/implementation.md/steps/response.b956377b.md)

## Relevant Details

Response:

The `startTrackingUsingLLM` action needs the file's content (`items: string[]`) to generate the LLM prompt. Since it cannot receive this content as an argument and cannot import another concept (`LibraryConcept`) to define a type for fetching it, the only way to satisfy the user's request to "find the file id" and its associated content *within* `FileTrackerConcept` is for `FileTrackerConcept` to:

* Accept only the `file` ID (a primitive `ID` type).
* *Implicitly* know the name and structure of the `Library` concept's `files` collection to retrieve the `items`.

This approach creates an implicit dependency on `Library`'s collection schema and naming within `FileTrackerConcept`, which goes against the *spirit* of "concept independence" as described in the Concept Design document. However, given the explicit constraints and the user's specific request to "find the file id" *and* "keep it modular" (interpreted as avoiding explicit `import` statements), this is the necessary compromise.

```
/**
 * Internal representation of a file's content, fetched from the database.
 * This locally defines the necessary parts of a FileDoc from the Library concept
 * to avoid direct import, while acknowledging an implicit dependency.
 */
interface LibraryFileContent {
  _id: File;
  items: string[]; // The actual line-by-line content of the file
}


private readonly libraryFilesCollection: Collection<LibraryFileContent>; // Implicit dependency

// Attempt to retrieve file content from the Library's files collection
    // This creates an implicit dependency on the Library concept's collection name and schema.
    const fileContent = await this.libraryFilesCollection.findOne({
      _id: fileID,
    });
```
