# response:

The error `require is not defined` indicates that you are running Deno, but your code is using `require()`, which is a CommonJS module loading syntax typically found in Node.js. Deno uses ES modules (`import`/`export`) by default.

To fix this, you need to change how you import `config.json` in your Deno test file.

**Here's the problem line:**

```typescript
    const config = require("../../../config.json");
```

**Here's how to fix it for Deno:**

Use a static `import` statement with an `assert { type: "json" }` clause. This tells Deno to load the file as a JSON module.

**Revised `src/concepts/FileTracker/FileTrackerConcept.test.ts`:**

```typescript
import {
  assertArrayIncludes,
  assertEquals,
  assertExists,
  assertNotEquals,
  assertObjectMatch,
} from "jsr:@std/assert";
import { testDb } from "@utils/database.ts";
import { ID } from "@utils/types.ts";
import FileTrackerConcept from "./FileTrackerConcept.ts";
import { Config, GeminiLLM } from "@utils/gemini-llm.ts";
// Remove this line: import process from "node:process";
// In Deno, use Deno.exit() if you need to exit, but it's generally better to throw errors in tests.

// --- CHANGE STARTS HERE ---
// Correct way to import JSON in Deno.
// `configData` will hold the parsed JSON object.
import configData from "../../../config.json" assert { type: "json" };

/**
 * Load configuration from config.json
 * This function is now a simple wrapper to return the already imported config
 * and perform any necessary validation.
 */
function loadConfig(): Config {
  // You can add validation here to ensure the config has the expected structure.
  // For example, checking for the existence of `geminiApiKey`.
  if (!configData || typeof configData.geminiApiKey !== 'string' || configData.geminiApiKey.length === 0) {
    console.error(
      "❌ Error: config.json is missing or has an invalid 'geminiApiKey'. Please ensure it exists with your API key.",
    );
    // In a test, throwing an error is generally better than Deno.exit(1)
    // as it allows the test runner to report a test failure cleanly.
    throw new Error("Invalid config.json: 'geminiApiKey' is missing or invalid.");
  }
  return configData as Config; // Cast to your Config type
}
// --- CHANGE ENDS HERE ---

// Define some generic User and File IDs for testing
const userAlice = "user:Alice" as ID;
const userBob = "user:Bob" as ID;

// actions, startTracking, deleteTracking, jumpTo, next, back, setVisibility, startTracking w/ llm

Deno.test("Principle: a user starts tracking their file from the first listed item, they can move through file items sequentially without losing their place or skip to a file item; and control how progress is displayed", async (t) => {
  const [db, client] = await testDb();
  let config: Config;
  try {
    config = loadConfig(); // Call the updated loadConfig
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Failed to load config: ${(error as Error).message}`);
    await client.close(); // Ensure client is closed even on config error
    throw error; // Re-throw to fail the test
  }

  const llm = new GeminiLLM(config);
  const concept = new FileTrackerConcept(db, llm);

  const file1 = "file:FileA" as ID;
  const file1MaxIndex = 9; // 10 items (0-indexed)

  await t.step(
    "1. User starts tracking a file normally (without LLM)",
    async () => {
      const result = await concept.startTracking({
        owner: userAlice,
        file: file1,
        maxIndex: file1MaxIndex,
      });
      assertNotEquals(
        "error" in result,
        true,
        "There should be no error tracking a new file",
      );
      const trackingId = (result as { id: ID }).id;
      assertExists(trackingId, "Expected to start tracking file successfully");

      // verify initial state (currentIndex = 0, isVisible= true)
      const currentStatus = await concept._getCurrentItem({
        owner: userAlice,
        file: file1,
      });
      assertExists(currentStatus, "Expected to retrieve tracking status");
      assertObjectMatch(
        currentStatus,
        { index: 0 },
        "Current index should be 0 initially after startTracking",
      );
    },
  );
  await client.close();
});
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **`import configData from "../../../config.json" assert { type: "json" };`**: This line now statically imports your `config.json` file. Deno parses it directly into a JavaScript object, which is assigned to the `configData` variable.
2. **`loadConfig()` function update**: The `loadConfig` function now simply returns the `configData` object that was imported. I've added a basic check to ensure `geminiApiKey` exists and is a string, which is good practice. In Deno, if an error prevents a test from continuing, it's better to `throw new Error()` than `Deno.exit(1)` (the equivalent of `process.exit(1)`), as `throw` allows the test runner to catch the error and report the test as failed without abruptly stopping the entire test process.
3. **Removed `import process from "node:process";`**: This module is Node.js specific and is not available in Deno. `Deno.exit()` is Deno's equivalent if you need to exit the process, but as mentioned, throwing an error is usually preferred in test scenarios.
4. **Error handling in the test**: Added a `try...catch` block around `loadConfig()` inside the `Deno.test` function to gracefully handle configuration loading failures. This ensures `client.close()` is called and the test fails explicitly if the config cannot be loaded.

With these changes, Deno will correctly load your `config.json` and your test should proceed without the `require is not defined` error.
