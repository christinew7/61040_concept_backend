# problem: Bug in `parseAndStartTracking` validation

The `parseAndStartTracking` method in `FileTrackerConcept.ts` attempts to validate the `currentIndex` returned by the LLM against an `indices.maxIndex` property. However, the `createTrackingPrompt` method explicitly instructs the LLM to return *only* a `currentIndex` in the format `{"currentIndex": {YOUR DETERMINED INDEX}}`. Consequently, `indices.maxIndex` will never be present in the LLM's response, causing the validation `indices.currentIndex > indices.maxIndex` to incorrectly compare `currentIndex` against `undefined`, which can lead to unexpected behavior or erroneous error messages.

The correct upper bound for `currentIndex` is the `fileMaxIndex` that was originally passed to `startTrackingUsingLLM` and subsequently to `parseAndStartTracking`.
