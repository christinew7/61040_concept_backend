# previous response:

The user has correctly identified that the `Library` concept's `_getAllFiles` query returns `FileDoc[]`, where `FileDoc` is a composite object (specifically, a plain JSON object with primitive and array-of-primitive properties). This implies a relaxation of the "primitive values (no custom objects)" constraint for return types of queries and, by extension, for complex input structures in actions if they are used to convey data like file content.

The `FileTrackerConcept`'s `startTrackingUsingLLM` action currently takes `{ owner: User; file: FileContentInput }` where `FileContentInput` is `{ id: File; items: string[] }`. This `file` parameter is already a composite object with an `ID` and an array of primitive strings. This aligns with the `Library` concept's approach of handling file content.

The main inconsistencies are in the *specification* of the `startTrackingUsingLLM` action for `FileTracker`:

1. **`file` argument type**: The spec `file: File` (which is an `ID`) doesn't match the implementation `file: FileContentInput` (which is `{ id: File, items: string[] }`).
2. **`llm` argument**: The spec includes `llm: GeminiLLM` as an action argument, but the implementation correctly uses `this.llm` (injected via the constructor), meaning `GeminiLLM` is an internal dependency and not an action parameter. Action parameters should be primitive values or simple JSON objects.

Therefore, the modifications will focus on updating the `FileTracker` concept specification to reflect its current, correct implementation and adhere to the guidelines. The existing implementation of `FileTrackerConcept`'s `startTrackingUsingLLM` already handles the composite `file` object as requested.
