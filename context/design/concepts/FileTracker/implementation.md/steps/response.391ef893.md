# response:

You're right to point out the strict interpretation of "primitive values (no custom objects)" when it comes to action arguments. An array of strings, while composed of primitive values, is itself a composite structure within a JSON object. This indeed means that `items: List<String>` cannot be passed directly within the action's single argument dictionary if we strictly adhere to this rule.

This constraint forces us to externalize the LLM's task of determining the `initialIndex`, as the `FileTrackerConcept` can no longer directly receive the file content it needs to prompt the LLM. The concept itself will no longer directly "use an LLM" for this action. Instead, it will provide an action to *start tracking at a specific, pre-calculated index*.

Here's how we'll modify the `FileTracker` concept to adhere to this strict interpretation:

1. **Remove `startTrackingUsingLLM` action**: This action, as designed, directly contradicts the "no `List<String>` in arguments" rule.
2. **Add `startTrackingWithCalculatedIndex` action**: This new action will allow a user (or an orchestrating layer) to provide an already calculated `startIndex` and `maxIndex`.
3. **Remove `GeminiLLM` dependency**: Since the LLM processing is no longer performed internally by `FileTrackerConcept`, the `GeminiLLM` instance will be removed from its constructor and class properties.

This means that an external service or application layer will now be responsible for:
a. Fetching the file content (`items: List<String>`) from the `LibraryConcept`.
b. Calling the `GeminiLLM` directly with that content to determine the `startIndex`.
c. Then, calling `FileTrackerConcept.startTrackingWithCalculatedIndex` with the `owner`, `file`, the derived `startIndex`, and the `maxIndex` (which is `items.length - 1`).

This design maintains concept isolation and strictly adheres to the input/output type constraints, though it shifts the LLM orchestration responsibility.

## Concept: FileTracker

* **concept**: FileTracker \[User, File]
* **purpose**: track current position and enable navigation within files
* **principle**: a user can start tracking their file from the first listed item (which might not be the first item); a user can also provide a pre-calculated starting index (e.g., from an LLM); they can move through file items sequentially without losing their place or skip to a file item; and control how progress is displayed
* **state**
  * a set of `TrackedFiles` with
    * an `owner` User
    * a `file` `File`
    * a `currentIndex` `Number`
    * a `maxIndex` `Number`
    * a `isVisible` `Flag`
* **actions**
  * `startTracking (owner: User, file: File, maxIndex: number)`
    * **requires** this `owner` exists, this `file` exists, this `maxIndex` is a nonnegative integer, this `owner` and this `file` isn't already in the set of `TrackedFiles`
    * **effects** create a new `TrackedFile` with this owner, this file and this `maxIndex`, `currentIndex` is initialized to 0, `isVisible` set to true
  * `startTrackingWithCalculatedIndex (owner: User, file: File, maxIndex: number, startIndex: number)`
    * **requires** this `owner` exists, this `file` exists, this `maxIndex` is a nonnegative integer, this `startIndex` is a non-negative integer and less than or equal to `maxIndex`, this `owner` and this `file` isn't already in the set of `TrackedFiles`
    * **effects** create a new `TrackedFile` with this `owner`, this `file`, this `maxIndex`, `currentIndex` is initialized to `startIndex`, `isVisible` set to true
  * `deleteTracking (owner: User, file: File)`
    * **requires** this `owner` and this `file` is in the set of TrackedFiles
    * **effects** delete the `TrackedFile` with this `owner` and this `file`
  * `jumpTo (owner: User, file: File, index: Number)`
    * **requires** this `owner` and this `file` exists in the TrackedFiles, this `index` is a valid index between 0 and the `maxIndex`
    * **effects** updates the `currentIndex` of the TrackedFile with this `owner` and this `file` to this `index`
  * `next (owner: User, file: File)`
    * **requires** this `owner` and this `file` exists in the TrackedFiles, the `currentIndex` of this TrackedFile is less than the `maxIndex`
    * **effects** increments the TrackedFile with this owner and this file by 1
  * `back (owner: User, file: File)`
    * **requires** this owner and this file exists in the TrackedFiles, the currentIndex of this TrackedFile is greater than 0
    * **effects** decrements the TrackedFile with this owner and this file by 1
  * `getCurrentItem (owner: User, file: File): (index: Number)`
    * **requires** this owner and this file exists in the TrackedFiles
    * **effects** in the TrackedFile with this owner and this file, return the currentIndex
  * `setVisibility (owner: User, file: File, visible: Flag)`
    * **requires** this owner and this file exists in the TrackedFiles
    * **effects** in the TrackedFile with this owner and this file, set isVisible to this visible
