# response:

The core problem, as described, is that `startTrackingUsingLLM` currently accepts an argument with a "composite object" (`file.items: string[]`) which violates the rule that action arguments must be "a dictionary/JSON object with primitive values (no custom objects)".

To resolve this, the `FileTrackerConcept` itself needs to be responsible for retrieving the file's content when needed for LLM processing, rather than having the content passed directly as an action argument. This can be achieved by injecting a `FileContentProvider` function into the `FileTrackerConcept`'s constructor.

### Proposed Solution:

1. **Modify `FileTrackerConcept` Constructor:** Add a `fileContentProvider` function to the constructor. This function will take a `File` ID (a branded string) and return the file's content as a `Promise<string[] | { error: string }>`.
2. **Update `startTrackingUsingLLM` Signature:** Change the `file` argument from `FileContentInput` to `File` (the ID).
3. **Fetch File Content Internally:** Inside `startTrackingUsingLLM`, call the injected `fileContentProvider` to retrieve the `string[]` content.
4. **Update `createTrackingPrompt` Signature:** Modify the private `createTrackingPrompt` method to directly accept `string[]` as its argument, as it will now receive the content directly from `startTrackingUsingLLM`.
5. **Remove `FileContentInput` Type:** This type is no longer exposed in action arguments and can be removed or moved to internal types if still needed for other purposes.

This approach ensures that `startTrackingUsingLLM` adheres to the rule of accepting only primitive values (or IDs which are branded strings) within its single JSON argument, while the concept still has access to the necessary file content for LLM processing.
