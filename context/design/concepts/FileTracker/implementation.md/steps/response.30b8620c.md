You're asking for clarification on the comment:

> (Note: The LLM dependency for this action is managed internally by the concept, and is configured during concept initialization, not passed as an action argument.)

Let's break down what this means in the context of the `FileTrackerConcept` and the rules for implementing concepts:

1. **What is an "LLM dependency"?**
   * `LLM` stands for Large Language Model (like Google's Gemini, which is used here).
   * A "dependency" means that the `FileTrackerConcept` needs a `GeminiLLM` object to perform its `startTrackingUsingLLM` action. It *depends* on the LLM to do its job.

2. **"managed internally by the concept"**:
   * This refers to *how* the `FileTrackerConcept` gets access to the `GeminiLLM`.
   * Instead of each call to `startTrackingUsingLLM` needing to receive a `GeminiLLM` object (like `concept.startTrackingUsingLLM({..., llm: myGeminiClient})`), the `FileTrackerConcept` *itself* holds onto a `GeminiLLM` instance.
   * You can see this in the class definition: `private readonly llm: GeminiLLM;`. This `llm` property is part of the `FileTrackerConcept` instance, making it an internal tool for the concept.

3. **"configured during concept initialization"**:
   * This explains *when* the `FileTrackerConcept` gets its `GeminiLLM` instance.
   * Look at the `FileTrackerConcept`'s constructor:
     ```typescript
     constructor(private readonly db: Db, llm: GeminiLLM) {
         this.trackedFiles = this.db.collection(PREFIX + "trackedFiles");
         this.llm = llm; // <-- The LLM is passed here when the concept is created.
     }
     ```
   * When you create a `new FileTrackerConcept(myDb, myGeminiLLMClient)`, you provide the `GeminiLLM` instance *once* when the `FileTrackerConcept` object is first created (initialized). The concept then stores it in its `this.llm` property for later use by its methods.

4. **"not passed as an action argument"**:
   * This is the crucial part that relates back to the concept implementation rules.
   * The rule states: "Every action must take a single argument, and output a single argument: both of these are a dictionary/JSON object with primitive values (no custom objects)."
   * A `GeminiLLM` object is a "custom object" (an instance of a class). If `startTrackingUsingLLM` had a parameter `llm: GeminiLLM`, it would violate this rule.
   * By *injecting* the `GeminiLLM` into the constructor (during initialization) instead of passing it to the action method directly, we ensure that the action's arguments remain simple JSON objects with primitive values, adhering to the specified constraint.

**In summary:**

The `FileTrackerConcept` needs an LLM to function. Instead of requiring you to provide the LLM *every time* you call `startTrackingUsingLLM` (which would violate the rule about action arguments being simple JSON objects), you provide the LLM *once* when you first create the `FileTrackerConcept` instance. The concept then manages that LLM internally, making it available to its actions without exposing it as a complex argument.
