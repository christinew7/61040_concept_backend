# response:

Here are some interesting scenarios for additional test cases for the `LikertSurvey` concept, going beyond the basic principle fulfillment:

## Additional Test Scenarios for `LikertSurveyConcept`

### Scenario 1: `createSurvey` Edge Cases and Multiple Surveys

This scenario focuses on `createSurvey`'s `requires` conditions regarding `scaleMin` and `scaleMax`, and then tests the ability to create multiple distinct surveys.

* **Test Cases**:
  * **Invalid Scale:** Attempt to create a survey where `scaleMin` is greater than `scaleMax` (e.g., `scaleMin: 5, scaleMax: 1`). Expect an error.
  * **Equal Scale:** Attempt to create a survey where `scaleMin` is equal to `scaleMax` (e.g., `scaleMin: 3, scaleMax: 3`). Expect an error.
  * **Valid but Narrow Scale:** Create a survey with a valid but very narrow scale (e.g., `scaleMin: 0, scaleMax: 1`). This should succeed.
  * **Multiple Surveys:** Create two completely separate surveys by the same author. Verify that they both exist and have distinct IDs and properties.

### Scenario 2: `addQuestion` with Duplicates and Query Verification

This scenario tests adding questions, including cases where question text might be identical, and then verifies the state using the query methods.

* **Test Cases**:
  * **Duplicate Question Text:** Add a question to a survey, then add *another* question to the *same* survey with identical text. This should succeed, as questions are identified by their unique IDs, not their text content. Verify two distinct question IDs are returned and found.
  * **Multiple Questions & Retrieval:** Add several unique questions to a single survey. Use `_getSurveyQuestions` to verify that all questions are correctly associated and retrieved.
  * **Question to Valid Survey, Different Author:** Create a survey with `authorA`. Then, an `authorB` creates *their own* survey. Verify `authorA` can add questions to *their* survey. (Implicitly covered if `addQuestion` only checks survey existence, not author ownership, as per the spec).

### Scenario 3: `submitResponse` and `updateResponse` Interaction and State Changes

This scenario delves into the interactions between `submitResponse` and `updateResponse`, especially with multiple respondents and ensuring state integrity.

* **Test Cases**:
  * **Multiple Respondents to Same Question**: Create a survey and a question. `RespondentB` submits a response. Then, `RespondentC` submits a response to the *exact same question*. Verify both responses are recorded and distinct for each respondent using `_getSurveyResponses`.
  * **Update Non-existent Response**: `RespondentB` attempts to `updateResponse` to a question they haven't answered yet. Expect an error.
  * **Successful Update Chain**: `RespondentB` submits a response. Then, `RespondentB` updates that response multiple times with valid values. Use `_getRespondentAnswers` to verify the final value and that only one response exists for that question.
  * **Submit After Update**: `RespondentB` submits a response, then successfully updates it. Then, `RespondentB` attempts to `submitResponse` again for the *same question*. Expect an error, as a response already exists and `submitResponse` doesn't overwrite.
  * **Invalid Update Value**: `RespondentB` submits a response. Then, `RespondentB` attempts to `updateResponse` with a value outside the survey's defined scale. Expect an error, and verify the original response value remains unchanged.

### Scenario 4: Querying Empty or Non-Existent States

This scenario ensures that the query methods handle situations where no data exists gracefully.

* **Test Cases**:
  * **Empty Survey Questions**: Create a survey, but add no questions to it. Call `_getSurveyQuestions` for this survey. Expect an empty array.
  * **Empty Survey Responses (No Questions)**: Create a survey, add no questions. Call `_getSurveyResponses` for this survey. Expect an empty array.
  * **Empty Survey Responses (Questions but No Answers)**: Create a survey and add several questions. No respondents submit answers. Call `_getSurveyResponses`. Expect an empty array.
  * **Non-existent Respondent Answers**: Call `_getRespondentAnswers` for a `Respondent` ID that has never submitted any responses. Expect an empty array.
  * **Queries for Non-existent Entities**: Query `_getSurveyQuestions` or `_getSurveyResponses` using a completely fake/non-existent `Survey` ID. Expect empty arrays. (The queries themselves don't validate survey existence, they just return what matches).

These scenarios aim to cover the different `requires` conditions, verify the `effects` through various state manipulations, and ensure the resilience and correctness of query operations under different data conditions.
