# response:

You're right, the assertion message `addTerm should succeed.` is incorrect because it's being used to test `translateTermFromL1`. Additionally, while `assertNotEquals("error" in result, true)` works, `assertEquals("error" in result, false)` is often considered more direct and readable for asserting the absence of an error.

Here's how to fix it:

```typescript
import { assertEquals, assertExists, assertNotEquals } from "jsr:@std/assert";
import { testDb } from "@utils/database.ts";
import { ID } from "@utils/types.ts";
import DictionaryConcept from "./DictionaryConcept.ts";
// Removed `ClientRequest` as it was unused and likely a leftover import.

// LANGUAGE1 = US
// LANGUAGE2 = UK
Deno.test(
  "Principle: the dictionary maintains a mapping of terms between two languages, a user can request the translation of a term, and the dictionary will provide the appropriate term in the other language",
  async (t) => {
    const [db, client] = await testDb();
    const concept = new DictionaryConcept(db);

    await t.step("1. Add one crochet translation term", async () => {
      const addTermResult = await concept.addTerm({
        language1: "double crochet",
        language2: "treble crochet",
      });
      assertEquals(
        "error" in addTermResult,
        false, // Assert that the 'error' key is NOT present
        "addTerm should succeed and not return an error.", // Corrected message
      );
      assertExists((addTermResult as { id: ID }).id, "The ID of the new term should be returned.");
    });

    await t.step("2. User requests translation from US to UK term for this term", async() => {
      const translateTermResult = await concept.translateTermFromL1({language1: "double crochet"});
      // FIX START: Corrected assertion message and structure
      assertEquals(
        "error" in translateTermResult,
        false, // Assert that the 'error' key is NOT present for a successful translation
        "translateTermFromL1 should succeed and not return an error.", // Corrected and specific message
      );
      // After confirming no error, we can safely access the language2 property.
      const { language2 } = translateTermResult as { language2: string };
      assertEquals(language2, "treble crochet", "The translation should be `treble crochet`");
      // FIX END
    })
    // The client.close() was outside the Deno.test block's scope in the original example,
    // which would lead to a runtime error. It must be inside the test function.
    await client.close();
  },
);

```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Corrected Assertion Message**:
   * For `addTerm`, the message is changed from `"addTerm should succeed."` to `"addTerm should succeed and not return an error."`.
   * For `translateTermFromL1`, the message is changed from `"addTerm should succeed."` to `"translateTermFromL1 should succeed and not return an error."`. This makes the test output much clearer about which action is being tested and what the expected outcome is.
2. **More Idiomatic `assertEquals`**:
   * Instead of `assertNotEquals("error" in result, true)`, which means "the expression 'error' in result is NOT equal to true", we use `assertEquals("error" in result, false)`. This explicitly states "the expression 'error' in result SHOULD be false", which is more direct for checking the absence of an error key.
3. **Type Narrowing for `translateTermResult`**:
   * After confirming that `"error" in translateTermResult` is `false`, TypeScript knows that `translateTermResult` must be of type `{ language2: string }`. I've added an explicit cast `const { language2 } = translateTermResult as { language2: string };` for clarity, though in many cases, if you directly access `translateTermResult.language2` after the `if (!("error" in translateTermResult))`, TypeScript would also correctly narrow the type.
4. **`client.close()` Placement**: I've moved `await client.close();` inside the `Deno.test` callback, but *after* all `t.step` calls. In your original snippet, it was outside the main `Deno.test` function body, which would make it unreachable or lead to an error because `client` is only defined within the `Deno.test` scope.

These changes make the tests more robust, readable, and provide clearer diagnostics if they fail.
