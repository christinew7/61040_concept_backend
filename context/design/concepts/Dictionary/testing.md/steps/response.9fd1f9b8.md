# response:

Yes, absolutely! The existing tests cover the principle and the core requirements/effects of each action. To make them more robust and cover "interesting scenarios" as per the concept testing guidelines, here are a few more test cases and why they are valuable:

### 1. Test Case: Survey with varied scale ranges (e.g., negative, zero-inclusive, narrow)

**Why it's interesting:** This probes the flexibility of the `scaleMin` and `scaleMax` parameters beyond the common 1-5 range. It ensures the validation logic works correctly for different numerical boundaries.

```typescript
Deno.test("Action: createSurvey and submitResponse handle diverse scale ranges", async (t) => {
  const [db, client] = await testDb();
  const surveyConcept = new LikertSurveyConcept(db);

  try {
    await t.step("1. Create survey with negative and zero-inclusive scale", async () => {
      const createResult = await surveyConcept.createSurvey({ author: authorA, title: "Mood Survey", scaleMin: -2, scaleMax: 2 });
      assertNotEquals("error" in createResult, true, "Creating a survey with negative/zero scale should succeed.");
      const { survey } = createResult as { survey: ID };
      assertExists(survey);

      const addQResult = await surveyConcept.addQuestion({ survey, text: "How is your mood?" });
      assertNotEquals("error" in addQResult, true, "Adding question should succeed.");
      const { question } = addQResult as { question: ID };
      assertExists(question);

      // Submit responses within the new scale
      let submitRes = await surveyConcept.submitResponse({ respondent: respondentB, question, value: -2 });
      assertEquals("error" in submitRes, false, "Submitting min negative value should succeed.");
      submitRes = await surveyConcept.submitResponse({ respondent: respondentC, question, value: 0 });
      assertEquals("error" in submitRes, false, "Submitting zero value should succeed.");
      submitRes = await surveyConcept.updateResponse({ respondent: respondentB, question, value: 2 });
      assertEquals("error" in submitRes, false, "Updating to max positive value should succeed.");

      // Submit responses outside the new scale
      submitRes = await surveyConcept.submitResponse({ respondent: "respondentD" as ID, question, value: -3 });
      assertEquals("error" in submitRes, true, "Submitting value below min negative should fail.");
      submitRes = await surveyConcept.submitResponse({ respondent: "respondentE" as ID, question, value: 3 });
      assertEquals("error" in submitRes, true, "Submitting value above max positive should fail.");

      const responses = await surveyConcept._getSurveyResponses({ survey });
      assertEquals(responses.length, 2, "Should have two valid responses.");
      assertEquals(responses.find(r => r.respondent === respondentB)?.value, 2);
      assertEquals(responses.find(r => r.respondent === respondentC)?.value, 0);
    });

    await t.step("2. Create survey with a very narrow scale (e.g., 1-2)", async () => {
      const createResult = await surveyConcept.createSurvey({ author: authorA, title: "Yes/No Survey", scaleMin: 1, scaleMax: 2 });
      assertNotEquals("error" in createResult, true, "Creating a survey with narrow scale should succeed.");
      const { survey: narrowSurvey } = createResult as { survey: ID };
      assertExists(narrowSurvey);

      const addQResult = await surveyConcept.addQuestion({ survey: narrowSurvey, text: "Do you agree?" });
      assertNotEquals("error" in addQResult, true, "Adding question to narrow survey should succeed.");
      const { question: narrowQ } = addQResult as { question: ID };
      assertExists(narrowQ);

      // Submit responses within the narrow scale
      let submitRes = await surveyConcept.submitResponse({ respondent: respondentB, question: narrowQ, value: 1 });
      assertEquals("error" in submitRes, false, "Submitting value 1 should succeed.");
      submitRes = await surveyConcept.submitResponse({ respondent: respondentC, question: narrowQ, value: 2 });
      assertEquals("error" in submitRes, false, "Submitting value 2 should succeed.");

      // Submit responses outside the narrow scale
      submitRes = await surveyConcept.submitResponse({ respondent: "respondentD" as ID, question: narrowQ, value: 0 });
      assertEquals("error" in submitRes, true, "Submitting value 0 should fail.");
      submitRes = await surveyConcept.submitResponse({ respondent: "respondentE" as ID, question: narrowQ, value: 3 });
      assertEquals("error" in submitRes, true, "Submitting value 3 should fail.");

      const responses = await surveyConcept._getSurveyResponses({ survey: narrowSurvey });
      assertEquals(responses.length, 2, "Should have two valid responses for narrow survey.");
    });
  } finally {
    await client.close();
  }
});
```

### 2. Test Case: Multiple respondents interacting with the same survey

**Why it's interesting:** This ensures that responses are correctly isolated per respondent and question, and that queries aggregate data from multiple respondents as expected.

```typescript
Deno.test("Multiple respondents can submit and update responses independently", async (t) => {
  const [db, client] = await testDb();
  const surveyConcept = new LikertSurveyConcept(db);

  try {
    const { survey } = (await surveyConcept.createSurvey({ author: authorA, title: "Multi-Respondent Survey", scaleMin: 1, scaleMax: 5 })) as { survey: ID };
    const { question: q1 } = (await surveyConcept.addQuestion({ survey, text: "Q1 Text" })) as { question: ID };
    const { question: q2 } = (await surveyConcept.addQuestion({ survey, text: "Q2 Text" })) as { question: ID };

    // Respondent B submits answers
    await surveyConcept.submitResponse({ respondent: respondentB, question: q1, value: 3 });
    await surveyConcept.submitResponse({ respondent: respondentB, question: q2, value: 4 });

    // Respondent C submits answers
    await surveyConcept.submitResponse({ respondent: respondentC, question: q1, value: 5 });
    await surveyConcept.submitResponse({ respondent: respondentC, question: q2, value: 2 });

    await t.step("1. Verify responses are unique per respondent", async () => {
      const bAnswers = await surveyConcept._getRespondentAnswers({ respondent: respondentB });
      assertEquals(bAnswers.length, 2, "Respondent B should have two answers.");
      assertEquals(bAnswers.find(r => r.question === q1)?.value, 3);
      assertEquals(bAnswers.find(r => r.question === q2)?.value, 4);

      const cAnswers = await surveyConcept._getRespondentAnswers({ respondent: respondentC });
      assertEquals(cAnswers.length, 2, "Respondent C should have two answers.");
      assertEquals(cAnswers.find(r => r.question === q1)?.value, 5);
      assertEquals(cAnswers.find(r => r.question === q2)?.value, 2);
    });

    await t.step("2. Verify survey responses aggregate all unique responses", async () => {
      const surveyResponses = await surveyConcept._getSurveyResponses({ survey });
      assertEquals(surveyResponses.length, 4, "The survey should have 4 total responses (2 from B, 2 from C).");
    });

    await t.step("3. Respondent B updates a response, C's response remains unchanged", async () => {
      await surveyConcept.updateResponse({ respondent: respondentB, question: q1, value: 1 });

      const bAnswers = await surveyConcept._getRespondentAnswers({ respondent: respondentB });
      assertEquals(bAnswers.find(r => r.question === q1)?.value, 1, "Respondent B's answer for Q1 should be updated.");

      const cAnswers = await surveyConcept._getRespondentAnswers({ respondent: respondentC });
      assertEquals(cAnswers.find(r => r.question === q1)?.value, 5, "Respondent C's answer for Q1 should remain unchanged.");

      const surveyResponses = await surveyConcept._getSurveyResponses({ survey });
      assertEquals(surveyResponses.length, 4, "Still 4 total responses after update.");
      assertExists(surveyResponses.find(r => r.respondent === respondentB && r.question === q1 && r.value === 1));
      assertExists(surveyResponses.find(r => r.respondent === respondentC && r.question === q1 && r.value === 5));
    });
  } finally {
    await client.close();
  }
});
```

### 3. Test Case: Querying in various empty/partial states

**Why it's interesting:** This checks the robustness of the query methods when no data or only partial data exists. It ensures they return empty arrays or correct subsets rather than throwing errors.

```typescript
Deno.test("Query methods return empty arrays for non-existent or empty data", async (t) => {
  const [db, client] = await testDb();
  const surveyConcept = new LikertSurveyConcept(db);

  try {
    // A survey exists, but no questions have been added yet
    const { survey: emptyQSurvey } = (await surveyConcept.createSurvey({ author: authorA, title: "Empty Q Survey", scaleMin: 1, scaleMax: 5 })) as { survey: ID };

    await t.step("1. _getSurveyQuestions on a survey with no questions", async () => {
      const questions = await surveyConcept._getSurveyQuestions({ survey: emptyQSurvey });
      assertEquals(questions.length, 0, "Should return an empty array if no questions exist for the survey.");
    });

    await t.step("2. _getSurveyResponses on a survey with no questions", async () => {
      const responses = await surveyConcept._getSurveyResponses({ survey: emptyQSurvey });
      assertEquals(responses.length, 0, "Should return an empty array if no questions (and thus no responses) exist for the survey.");
    });

    const { question: q1 } = (await surveyConcept.addQuestion({ survey: emptyQSurvey, text: "Q1" })) as { question: ID };
    const { question: q2 } = (await surveyConcept.addQuestion({ survey: emptyQSurvey, text: "Q2" })) as { question: ID };

    await t.step("3. _getSurveyResponses on a survey with questions but no responses", async () => {
      const responses = await surveyConcept._getSurveyResponses({ survey: emptyQSurvey });
      assertEquals(responses.length, 0, "Should return an empty array if questions exist but no responses have been submitted.");
    });

    await t.step("4. _getRespondentAnswers for a respondent who hasn't answered anything", async () => {
      const answers = await surveyConcept._getRespondentAnswers({ respondent: "nonExistentRespondent" as ID });
      assertEquals(answers.length, 0, "Should return an empty array for a respondent with no answers.");
    });

    // Add one response
    await surveyConcept.submitResponse({ respondent: respondentB, question: q1, value: 3 });

    await t.step("5. _getSurveyResponses after a partial response submission", async () => {
      const responses = await surveyConcept._getSurveyResponses({ survey: emptyQSurvey });
      assertEquals(responses.length, 1, "Should return one response.");
      assertEquals(responses[0].respondent, respondentB);
    });
  } finally {
    await client.close();
  }
});
```

These additional tests provide a more comprehensive validation of the `LikertSurvey` concept, covering various common and edge-case scenarios beyond the basic operational principle.
