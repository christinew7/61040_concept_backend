# response:

You are correct! My apologies, I accidentally included a test case from the `LibraryConcept` within the `LikertSurveyConcept.test.ts` file. This test case, titled "Scenario: Multiple users manage their independent libraries," is entirely irrelevant to the `LikertSurvey` concept and should be removed.

Here's the corrected `src/likertsurvey/LikertSurveyConcept.test.ts` file with the extraneous test removed. The existing tests for `LikertSurvey` are good and cover the principle, and various `requires` and `effects` for each action.
