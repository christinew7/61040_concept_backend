# trace:

The following trace demonstrates how the **principle** of the `Library` concept is fulfilled by a sequence of actions.

**Principle**: A user creates a library to store their files; the user can add, retrieve, modify, or delete files within their library; and they can delete the library if it's no longer needed.

1. **Given**: A user `user:Alice`.
2. **Action**: Alice creates her library.
   ```typescript
   libraryConcept.create({ owner: "user:Alice" })
   ```
3. **Result**: A new library is created, and its ID is returned. Initially, it contains no files.
   ```json
   { "library": "library:Alice_ID" }
   ```
4. **Action**: Alice adds a file to her library.
   ```typescript
   libraryConcept.addFile({ owner: "user:Alice", items: ["report.pdf", "data.csv"] })
   ```
5. **Result**: The file is successfully added.
   ```json
   {}
   ```
6. **Action**: Alice adds another file to her library.
   ```typescript
   libraryConcept.addFile({ owner: "user:Alice", items: ["image.jpg"] })
   ```
7. **Result**: The second file is successfully added.
   ```json
   {}
   ```
8. **Action**: Alice retrieves all files in her library to see her collection.
   ```typescript
   libraryConcept._getAllFiles({ owner: "user:Alice" })
   ```
9. **Result**: A list of two files is returned, containing "report.pdf", "data.csv" and "image.jpg".
   ```json
   { "files": [
       { "_id": "file:ID1", "library": "library:Alice_ID", "items": ["report.pdf", "data.csv"], "dateAdded": "..." },
       { "_id": "file:ID2", "library": "library:Alice_ID", "items": ["image.jpg"], "dateAdded": "..." }
   ]}
   ```
10. **Action**: Alice modifies the first file, changing its content. (Assuming `file:ID1` was retrieved in the previous step)
    ```typescript
    libraryConcept.modifyFile({ owner: "user:Alice", file: "file:ID1", items: ["updated_report.docx", "new_data.xlsx"] })
    ```
11. **Result**: The file is successfully modified.
    ```json
    {}
    ```
12. **Action**: Alice deletes the second file. (Assuming `file:ID2` was retrieved previously)
    ```typescript
    libraryConcept.deleteFile({ owner: "user:Alice", file: "file:ID2" })
    ```
13. **Result**: The file is successfully deleted.
    ```json
    {}
    ```
14. **Action**: Alice decides she no longer needs her library and deletes it.
    ```typescript
    libraryConcept.delete({ owner: "user:Alice" })
    ```
15. **Result**: The library and all its remaining associated files are deleted.
    ```json
    {}
    ```
16. **Verification**: If Alice tries to retrieve files again, it should indicate her library no longer exists.
    ```typescript
    libraryConcept._getAllFiles({ owner: "user:Alice" })
    ```
17. **Result**: An error indicating no library is found, confirming the deletion.
    ```json
    { "error": "User user:Alice does not have a library." }
    ```
