Okay, I understand. The goal is to refine the `Library` concept to align even more strictly with the principle of not exposing or accepting composite objects as action arguments, but rather primitive values (like strings) or object identifiers.

Currently, the `addFile` and `modifyFile` actions take `items: List<String>`, which is a composite object (an array of strings). We will change the concept such that a "file" in the library stores a single `String` as its `content` (instead of `List<String>` as `items`), and the actions will take this `content` directly as a `String` argument.

Here's the updated concept specification and implementation:
