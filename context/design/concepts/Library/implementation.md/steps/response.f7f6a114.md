# response:

You're absolutely right to focus on avoiding composite objects in action arguments. This is a crucial principle in concept design for maintaining modularity and clear contracts.

Here's a revised `Library` concept, incorporating `createFile`, `addItemToFile`, `modifyItemInFile`, and `removeItemFromFile` actions that work with single strings or IDs, while keeping the `items: List<String>` internally within the `FileDoc` for the content storage.
