# prompt: can you change my Library Concept implementation so addFile takes in just a string or just an Item ID, and add a new action called addItem or something that prevents these actions from taking composite objects and only take in strings . you might need to change the specification as well. i want the file content to eventually take in a list of strings, but internally, or in add file, addItemToFile(item) , maybe modify at Index of the file.
