# Changes

* I had to change the spec to my FileTracker to pass in the maxIndex (size of the File) in the `startTracking` action because this would keep the concepts modular. Otherwise, I would have to use the File concept to query the file and then calculate the size from there and pass it into my FileTracker concept.
* I updated the PasswordAuthentication Concept so it would not take empty usernames because that wouldn't make sense in the real world
* I changed the Dictionary Concept to have the terms be case insensitive because the cases don't matter in this context.
